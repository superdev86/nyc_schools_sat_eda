# NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis

This project analyzes SAT performance data of New York City (NYC) public schools to answer key questions about academic performance across the city. Using Python and pandas, insights are derived from a dataset (`schools.csv`) to assist stakeholders like policymakers, researchers, and parents. The analysis includes:

### Key Questions Addressed:
1. **Best Math Results:** Identified schools with the highest math performance (at least 80% of the maximum score of 800).
2. **Top 10 Schools:** Ranked schools based on total SAT scores (sum of math, reading, and writing scores).
3. **Largest Borough Variation:** Determined which borough exhibits the largest standard deviation in total SAT scores, with insights on the number of schools and average scores.

### Highlights:
- **Data Filtering & Transformation:** Extracted and sorted relevant data using pandas.
- **Key Metrics:** Combined SAT scores for overall performance and borough-wise statistical analysis.
- **Results:** 
  - Stuyvesant High School leads in both math and combined SAT scores.
  - Manhattan exhibits the largest variation in SAT performance.

### Files:
- `schools.csv`: Input dataset containing SAT performance data for NYC public schools.
- `analysis.py`: Python script containing the data analysis logic.
